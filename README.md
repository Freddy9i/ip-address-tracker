# IP Address Tracker

This React page uses the [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/) API and the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library to provide the location, postal code, ISP and estimated position of a given IP address.  

When entered it initially shows the information associated with your device, to see it again after searching for another IP just make an empty search.
